Some python classes for parsing Minecraft level data.

** These worked with the Alpha. I haven't tested with the Beta. **

ParseMinecraftAlpha is a package for reading Minecraft level files.
It won't read an entire level, just one file. More programming will
be required to read a whole level.

The other two files (MinecraftGeneralUtils and MinecraftPlayerUtils)
have some convience methods for poking at the level data, or at least
that was the plan. They don't do a lot right now.
